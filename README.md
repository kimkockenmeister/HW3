# HW3

In Hw 3 we used our python skills to analyze different CSV files. 
In the HW3 folder you will find it separated by 2 folders. PyBank and PyPoll. In PyBank you will find a python script that will do the following:

The total number of months included in the dataset
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

there is also an analysis folder that will export a txt file with the the product as well. the resource folder holds the csv file that we use. 

In PyPoll you will find a python script that will do the following:
The total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
The percentage of votes each candidate won
The total number of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote.
